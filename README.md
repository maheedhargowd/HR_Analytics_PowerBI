# HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI

## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data using **Power BI** to derive actionable insights for Human Resources teams. The dashboard visualizes key metrics, such as attrition rates, salary distribution, employee demographics, and departmental breakdowns, enabling data-driven decision-making to reduce turnover and improve employee retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Data Transformation**: Transformed the dataset by adding additional columns such as:
  - **Age Group**: Grouped employees into specific age brackets.
  - **Attrition Count**: Counted the number of employees leaving by different attributes (age, department, job role, etc.).
  - **Salary Slabs**: Created salary ranges to analyze employee attrition patterns across different income groups.
  
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Developed a series of interactive visualizations to analyze:
  - **Attrition by Education Level, Salary, and Age Group**.
  - **Attrition by Department** and **Job Role**.
  - **Attrition by Number of Years at the Company**.
  - **Attrition breakdown by Gender**.

- **Employee Metrics Analysis**:
  - Visualized average employee age, salary, and tenure in the company.
  - Provided a clear view of attrition rates and total employee count.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Power BI**: Used for data analysis, transformation, and visualization.
- **Excel**: For initial dataset preparation and minor transformations.

## 📊 Visualizations

1. **Attrition by Education**: Shows how different educational backgrounds impact employee turnover.
2. **Attrition by Salary and Age Group**: Analyzes salary ranges and age groups with higher attrition rates.
3. **Attrition by Department and Years in the Company**: Highlights departments with high attrition and how tenure affects employee retention.
4. **Job Role & Gender Distribution**: Examines the impact of job roles and gender on attrition.
